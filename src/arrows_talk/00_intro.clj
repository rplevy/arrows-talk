  "Arrow macros" or "threading macros" as they are called ...

  (and this has nothing to do threads in the
        concurrency and
        parallelism sense)

  ... are:

  1. a way of making nested calls more readable.


  2. a testament to the uniqueness and power of macros in Lisp

  languages. Arrows are a syntactic innovation in both the

  language core and the userland of the Clojure community.)
